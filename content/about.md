![Bonjour](https://media.giphy.com/media/dBCh3ktuUekw5OMJqg/giphy.gif)

French engineering student in cybersecurity, I like the web, reverse, crafting ELF and assembly.

I participate in CTFs with my team [FakeNews](https://fakenews.sh). I mostly do the web challenge because this is the easiest when you begin in cybersecurity. :innocent:

# Why this website

The first need of this blog was to help me to remind things as I learn them, and this is a great chance to share my knowledges with others!

The idea is to present subjects linked with security, for all levels (beginner to more advanced). I started with common domains, and with time I will share more advanced intel as I learn them.
