*So I came up with this basic concept: **`TL;DR`**. But what is it exactly?*

---

## The TL;DR series

The main idea is to share some knowledge in a quick and concise way, such as a [RUMP](https://www.sstic.org/2018/news/rumps_2018/) but written on a file. It is like a writeup speedrunning-ish style of writting. ~~And maybe because I am kind of lazy sometimes.~~

The goal here is to write small articles about a subject I like, a new technique learnt, or anything that is not worth a full and detailed article.

You will be able to get all `TL;DR` series with the tag [`tldr`](/tags/tldr/) on every article I will publish in the future.

**Have fun reading!**
