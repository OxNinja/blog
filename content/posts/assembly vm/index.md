To make things short, I saw [How to write a virtual machine in order to hide your viruses and break your brain forever](https://tmpout.sh/2/7.html) by [@s01den](https://twitter.com/s01den) published in [tmp.out](https://tmpout.sh)'s second edition. This new paper made me enjoy (once again) low-level. I wanted to know more about this abstract subject of "virtual machines" in reverse engineering, so I read it and started to implement my own VM in assembly!

## Why assembly?

I wanted to understand everything I did during this process, and needed to stick with the lowest level I could, I will talk about the future of this project at the end of the post.

I was also already familiar with assembly, especially nasm for Linux, and wanted to test my knowledge.

## Design

Before staring to type very fast on my keyboard, I needed to put things on a paper, in order to have a clear overview of the project.

I had to answer a few questions:

* What is an instruction?
* How does the CPU knows what to do with an instruction?
* How can I make custom instructions?
* How can I make the CPU execute my custom instructions?

## PoC

### Registers

### Instructions

### Execution

## Future

In a future post I will cover how to improve this VM, especially using a fully emulated virtual memory, using C.
