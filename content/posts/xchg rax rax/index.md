## Forewords

{{< admonition tip "Note" >}}
So recently a coworker of mine showed a book about assembly poems, at first I was like "well this joke is very funny" and then I read the first page. 5 minutes later I ordered the same book for my own, and now that it has been received, I want to write my notes here.
{{< /admonition >}}

[There is an online and free version of the book.](https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html)

I will try to understand each 64 pages of this awesome work, in order to maintain my assembly knowledge and to learn new tricks.

Of course I can be wrong in my interpretations of certain code or instructions, if so, feel free to help me improve!

## 0x00

```asm
xor      eax,eax
lea      rbx,[0]
loop     $
mov      rdx,0
and      esi,0
sub      edi,edi
push     0
pop      rbp
```

The first page is pretty straightforward. As you can see every line sets one register to `0`.

Every instruction here is very common and easy to understand, but one thing caught my attention: `loop $`. So let's dig a bit here.

`loop <label>` can be resumed like so:

```asm
loop:
    ; if cx == 0 jmp to end
    test cx, cx
    jnz $+3

    dec cx
    jmp loop
```

As you can see, it decrements `cx` at each iteration until it is `0`. So a `loop $` would simply set `cx` to `0`, as the label to loop through is `$`, the symbol for the actual address.

Normally with `loop label` you would have some code between `label` and the loop instruction, but here there is none, so the loop only decrements `cx`.

Pretty sneaky trick.

## 0x01

```asm
.loop:
    xadd     rax,rdx
    loop     .loop
```

This one is a little trick and pretty obfuscated but was very quick to understand. In fact, this loop produces the fibonacci sequence for the first `cx` elements.

As we learnt about `loop` at [0x00](#0x00), it loops until `cx` equals `0`, and here there is one instruction which gets exectued within the loop.

`xadd` is quite uncommon, this instruction can be coded as:

```asm
xadd:
    ; swap rax and rdx
    xchg rax, rdx

    ; rdx = rdx + rax
    mov r8, rdx
    add r8, rax
    mov rdx, r8
```

One experienced programmer can spot the algorithm to compute the fibonacci sequence here, which calculate the sum of the two previous elements of the sequence.

## 0x02

```asm
neg      rax
sbb      rax,rax
neg      rax
```

This code was a bit tricky, after discussing with friends we agreed to say that this code tells if `rax` is different than `0`.

At first I said that it tells the sign of `rax`, but I missunderstood the `sbb` instruction.
