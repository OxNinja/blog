# üèåÔ∏è BGGP3 - How to crash a famous JS engine for fun


So this summer, and it has been this for the past 2 years, the famous [Binary Golfing Grand Prix](https://tmpout.sh/bggp/3/) took place online for it's 3rd edition, and of course I decided to give it a try.

After getting to try my best at golfing binaries ([see my golfing posts](/tags/golf/)), I had to race this competition for fun and learn a lot about fuzzing.

## What is fuzzing?

Fuzzing a binary is like bruteforcing a binary's input (cmd args, input file...) in order to get an odd behaviour, a bug or even the holy crash.

There are a lot of tools in order to help users to fuzz a binary and optimize the results (execs/s, payload mutation, harnesses...) and they are pretty easy to use.

The first tutorials online and my own knowledge led me to the famous `AFL`, or more exactly it's big brother `AFL++`. So I will go with this tool for this grand prix in order to familiarize myself with it.
