After getting to try my best at golfing binaries (see my golfing posts), I had to race this competition for fun and learn a lot about fuzzing.
What is fuzzing? Fuzzing a binary is like bruteforcing a binary&amp;rsquo;s input (cmd args, input file&amp;hellip;) in order to get an odd behaviour, a bug or even the holy crash.</description></item><item><title>üèåÔ∏è Binary golfing - Introduction</title><link>https://0xninja.fr/binary-golf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>0xNinja</author><guid>https://0xninja.fr/binary-golf/</guid><description>So tmp.out - once again - got me. Especially netspooky, wich wrote about golfing binaries. Instantly I was caught in golfing.
Binary golfing? Crafting the smallest binary which does a particular task.
Why someone would do this?
Learn about binary executables and format parsers Flex on muggles My notes on ELF format It is recommanded to code in assembly in order to manage your headers as you wish.
We can handcraft binaries, because GCC is a bit messy when compiling code and linking stuff.</description></item></channel></rss>
