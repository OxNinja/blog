## `pwn`?

Refering to the 'binary exploitation' category, `pwn` is about exploiting weaknesses in low-level and bad code issues. For exemple corrupting the memory if a program does not sanitise the user input.

I [did a walkthrough of a pwn lab a few years ago](https://fakenews.sh/blog/startingpwnt-rop-part-walkthrough/), I found it cool and wanted to share my experience in this post.
