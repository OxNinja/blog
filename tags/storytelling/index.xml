But what is it exactly?
The TL;DR series The main idea is to share some knowledge in a quick and concise way, such as a RUMP but written on a file. It is like a writeup speedrunning-ish style of writting. And maybe because I am kind of lazy sometimes.
The goal here is to write small articles about a subject I like, a new technique learnt, or anything that is not worth a full and detailed article.</description></item></channel></rss>
