TL;DR XSS to steal Moodle creds of teacher, privesc as manager and then RCE. Get MySQL in config file, dump users and get password hash. Break the hash with john to ssh as user. Common pkg install exploit for root.

TL;DR Exfilter files on device using ES File explorer exploit, get user credentials. Root is straightforward with ADB.
Footholds With nmap we get the following:

TL;DR Find PCAP file on server, get SSH credentials, execute code as root with Python.
Footholds I did not even use nmap here, as we had a web server serving on port tcp:80. This website looked like this:
It seems to be a security dashboard for a server, we don&amp;rsquo;t have any info about that.</description></item><item><title>üì¶ HTB - Ready</title><link>https://0xninja.fr/posts/htb-ready/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xninja.fr/posts/htb-ready/</guid><description>Cool box, maybe too easy for a medium? Got reverse shell in minutes, but stuck for root&amp;rsquo;s password for hours üòÖ
TL;DR Gitlab RCE, get reverse shell. Privesc with cleartext root password, escape Docker to own the box.

User with hardcoded SQL credentials on server, privesc with custom binary with no $PATH check.
As I am an idiot, I reinstalled my distribution without making a backup of my files üôà So I don&amp;rsquo;t have any screenshot or payloads I used for this box to show you
Footholds With a basic nmap we found only two ports: 22 and 80.</description></item><item><title>üì¶ HTB - Obscurity</title><link>https://0xninja.fr/posts/htb-obscurity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xninja.fr/posts/htb-obscurity/</guid><description>Obscurity is my first medium box so I was very happy when I got that root.txt :D
TL;DR Custom Python web server, get source code, get revserse shell, crack user password for custom encryption system, use john to privesc.
Footholds To make things easier, I added the box to my /etc/hosts.
Recon Let&amp;rsquo;s start with nmap to discover the open ports :
&amp;gt; nmap -A obscurity.htb -o nmap.out Nmap scan report for obscurity.</description></item></channel></rss>
