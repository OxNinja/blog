Got reverse shell in minutes, but stuck for root&amp;rsquo;s password for hours 😅
TL;DR Gitlab RCE, get reverse shell. Privesc with cleartext root password, escape Docker to own the box.

And I will go through all levels in this blog post, explainning the expected way to solve each of them.
The lab currently contains 5 levels, and I will update this post as I add more of them 👍
Installation The GitHub repository is at https://github.com/OxNinja/SQLi-lab if you want more information.
First I clone the lab in a folder, add its IP to my hosts file for conveignance, and then build it with the given script:</description></item><item><title>📦 HTB - Magic</title><link>https://0xninja.fr/posts/htb-magic/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xninja.fr/posts/htb-magic/</guid><description>TL;DR HTTP redirect bypass (unintended 😁), PHP code execution through file upload to get a reverse shell. User with hardcoded SQL credentials on server, privesc with custom binary with no $PATH check.
As I am an idiot, I reinstalled my distribution without making a backup of my files 🙈 So I don&amp;rsquo;t have any screenshot or payloads I used for this box to show you
Footholds With a basic nmap we found only two ports: 22 and 80.</description></item><item><title>📦 HTB - Obscurity</title><link>https://0xninja.fr/posts/htb-obscurity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xninja.fr/posts/htb-obscurity/</guid><description>Obscurity is my first medium box so I was very happy when I got that root.txt :D
TL;DR Custom Python web server, get source code, get revserse shell, crack user password for custom encryption system, use john to privesc.
Footholds To make things easier, I added the box to my /etc/hosts.
Recon Let&amp;rsquo;s start with nmap to discover the open ports :
&amp;gt; nmap -A obscurity.htb -o nmap.out Nmap scan report for obscurity.</description></item></channel></rss>
